## General Info
A school factory for creating schools with unique names of different educations levels. Define the class sizes of the schools, regardless of the level, and define unique parameters to the respective levels such as sports teams for the High Schools and policies for picking up the students from school for students of the primary school. Call upon a 'quick fact' about the school objects you create to see the name, student body size, and education levels tought, and enlist the help of substitute teachers by calling upon the included static method 'pickSubstituteTeacher', selecting randomly from an array of eligable candidates!
